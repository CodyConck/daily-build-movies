# daily-build-movies

This simple site fetches a Movie from a movie api, and will generate a random title and change the background image to that movie's poster on each click.

It uses bootstrap, react, and babel cdns.

Good practice for frontend skills ;)

Refactored this based off of a previous build from freeCodeCamp
